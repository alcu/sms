SPSPpulseset.mat is a Matlab workspace that contains SPSP pulses computed with
different "alpha" values based on our publication "Spectral-spatial pulse
design for through-plane phase precompensatory slice selection in T2*-weighted
functional MRI" in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 2009.  It includes three
kinds of variables:


1. gz		:real-value z gradient waveform (unit: Gauss/cm (g/cm))
2. b		:complex-value RF waveform (unit: g)
3. mresult	:complex-value Bloch simulation result (normalized)

The number(s) in each b or gz variable name indicate the "alpha" value (in
units of 1E-4 g/cm/Hz) for which the RF and z gradient waveforms were
computed, and each of the (b,gz) pairs leads to Bloch simulation result in
variable mresult with the same number(s). Please refer to
centralscript_example.m for source code.  In the following we provide
parameters with which the waveforms were computed and the Bloch simulation was
performed:


z gradient (gz)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sampling period = 4E-6 s
max gradient amplitude = 4 g/cm
max gradient slew rate = 15000 g/cm/s
oscillation period (T, in s) and number of trapezoids (Ntraps):

%   alpha=-1:   T = 0.0025;   Ntraps = 6;
%   alpha=-1.25:T = 0.0025;   Ntraps = 6;
%   alpha=-1.5: T = 0.0025;   Ntraps = 6;
%   alpha=-1.75:T = 0.0025;   Ntraps = 7;
%   alpha=-2:   T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 7;
%   alpha=-2.25:T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 7;
%   alpha=-2.5: T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 8;
%   alpha=-2.75:T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 8;
%   alpha=-3:   T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 9;
%   alpha=-3.25:T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 10;
%   alpha=-3.5: T = 0.003;    Ntraps = 10;
